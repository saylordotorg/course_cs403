**Unit 10: The Join Statement** <span id="10"></span> 
*Programmers frequently join data from a number of different tables in
order to obtain more information.  They also—perhaps even more
frequently—build queries to obtain information from more than one table
in order to generate better information.  In this section, we will learn
about SQL Joins, which allow us to create complex queries, combine data
from different tables, and obtain a new result set that can provide us
with a better understanding of the data and maximize database
flexibility.  *
