**Unit 5: The Relational Database Model** <span id="5"></span> 
*The relational database model provides us with a way to understand how
data can be perceived.  While the E-R model represents the relations
between elements of a database, it does not provide a conceptual view of
its data.  We will use the relational model to solve that problem.  The
relational model looks at entities as tables and allows operations to be
performed on them.  In this unit,* *we will learn how to map ER models
into relations.*
