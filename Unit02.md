**Unit 2: Database Architecture and Date Languages** <span
id="2"></span> 
*In order to properly create and then manage a database, we need to have
a thorough understanding of the data it holds. * *Because data can be
seen from different levels, we will introduce different data models and
learn how to apply them in order to describe the structure of the
database, thereby providing a “view” of the database for the different
types of users introduced in the previous section.*

    clear explanation of the concepts of a relational database using
    Microsoft Excel. Note that a “primary key” is a special type of
    index - one that is unique and the main or primary value used to
    locate an entry in a database.
