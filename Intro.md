Course Syllabus for "CS403: Introduction to Modern Database Systems"
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Though we may not recognize them in our everyday activities, databases
are everywhere.  They are hidden behind your online banking profile,
airline reservation systems, medical records, and even employment
records.  This course will provide students with a general overview of
databases, introducing you to database history, modern database systems,
the different models used to design a database, and Structured Query
Language (SQL), which is the standard language used to access and
manipulate databases.   Many of the principles of database systems carry
to other areas in computer science, especially operating systems. 
Databases are often thought of as one of the core computer science
topics, since many other areas in the discipline have been derived from
this area.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  
  

-   Compare and contrast the database approach and the file system
    approach.
-   Explain what a database management system is as well as the various
    components.
-   Identify the various people involved in database management systems.
-   Explain the historical background of database management systems.
-   Compare the various database models.
-   Describe the functions of a database management system.
-   Explain the three-schema database architecture.
-   Describe what tables, indexes, and views are as well as discuss the
    differences among them.
-   Explain the entity-relationship model.
-   Develop an entity-relationship model based on user requirements.
-   Describe the relational database model.
-   Explain the process of normalization.
-   Convert an entity-relationship diagram to a set of normalized
    relations.
-   Explain referential integrity.
-   Identify how relational algebra is used to construct queries.
-   Describe and use data definition commands.
